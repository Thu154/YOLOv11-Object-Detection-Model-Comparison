Objective
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of four different versions of the YOLOv11 object detection model â€” YOLOv11-S, YOLOv11-M, YOLOv11-L, and YOLOv11-X â€” in terms of inference time, detection accuracy, and object count. The objective is to identify the most suitable model based on speed and detection performance.

Dataset Overview
Source Image: buses.jpeg (sample image containing multiple objects).
Models Tested:
YOLOv11-S â€“ Small model, optimized for speed and low memory usage.
YOLOv11-M â€“ Medium-sized model, balanced between speed and accuracy.
YOLOv11-L â€“ Large model, more accurate but slower inference.
YOLOv11-X â€“ Extra-large model, highest accuracy but slowest inference.
Project Workflow
1. Model Loading and Prediction

âœ… Installed the Ultralytics YOLO package for object detection.
âœ… Loaded the pre-trained YOLOv11 models from custom .pt files.
âœ… Performed inference on the sample image using each model with a confidence threshold of 0.5.
âœ… Saved the detection results for visualization.

2. Post-Prediction Processing

âœ… Loaded the predicted output images for all four models.
âœ… Converted BGR images to RGB for proper visualization.
âœ… Plotted the results using a 2x2 grid for easy comparison.

3. Performance Metrics Comparison

âœ… Collected the following performance metrics for each model:

Inference Time: Time taken for the model to perform inference on the image (in milliseconds).
Objects Detected: Total number of objects detected by each model.
Confidence Threshold: Fixed at 0.5 across all models for consistency.
âœ… Created a summary table using Pandas to compare model performance.

Results and Comparison
Model	Inference Time (ms)	Objects Detected	Confidence Threshold
YOLO11-S	15.2	9	0.5
YOLO11-M	22.4	12	0.5
YOLO11-L	45.8	14	0.5
YOLO11-X	78.6	16	0.5
Insights
ðŸ“Œ YOLO11-S:

Fastest model with lowest inference time (15.2 ms).
Suitable for real-time processing but missed some objects.
ðŸ“Œ YOLO11-M:

Balanced speed and accuracy (22.4 ms).
Detected more objects than YOLO11-S with minimal increase in inference time.
ðŸ“Œ YOLO11-L:

Higher accuracy (14 objects) but with increased inference time (45.8 ms).
Better for offline or batch processing.
ðŸ“Œ YOLO11-X:

Detected the most objects (16) but at the cost of very high inference time (78.6 ms).
Suitable for high-precision tasks where speed is less critical.
Performance-Accuracy Tradeoff
Model	Strength	Weakness
YOLO11-S	Fastest	Lower accuracy
YOLO11-M	Balanced	Slightly higher inference time
YOLO11-L	Higher accuracy	Increased inference time
YOLO11-X	Highest accuracy	Slowest inference time
Conclusion
âœ… YOLO11-S â†’ Best for real-time applications with low processing power.
âœ… YOLO11-M â†’ Best for a balance between accuracy and speed.
âœ… YOLO11-L â†’ Best for applications requiring higher detection accuracy.
âœ… YOLO11-X â†’ Best for high-precision tasks where speed is not a concern.
Next Steps
